Absolutely pathetic. Clumsy, dull, slow. It has unbelievable characters, improbable situations, implausible plotting. 

This book is Chaotic and pretty much without a plot, not to mention it was written in such a stilted manner. Is Lagercrantz intent on destroying Larsson's legacy?

Horowitz is bloody brilliant! I loved how this is some crazy mix of mystery, memoir, essay on how to write, how a tv show is created, all rolled into one.

Clever! Brilliant! I don’t think I will ever write a review for this author’s work without those two words included.

I’ve been postponing reading this book for a while, always put off by the plot that sounded way to John Grishammy for me. And I was right. A rating of 3.96 is waaaay, waaay higher than it should be in my opinion. I personally didn’t like how safe it felt and how much effort Horrowitz put into apologising…it’s called fiction for a reason.

It is not a good book, so cunfusing.

Crapy

This is brillant. one of the best books I have ever read

I absolutuly hate this book. Not enough plot

I love the writign style of this author, it really comes out in this book. This novel has made it onto my top ten list.
